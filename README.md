# 🎯 YOLOv8 Object Tracking using Python and OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time object tracking in video using the YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. The system detects objects and assigns a unique ID to each object, allowing consistent tracking across multiple frames.

The `persist=True` feature ensures that each object keeps the same ID throughout the video.
